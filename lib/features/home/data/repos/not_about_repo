What is the Repository Pattern ?

It's about an (abstract class)
- determine inside it the all Featured methods only
- without Implementation
- determine return type and argument
- (Handle Exception) Don't use try & catch inside it ==> use : Return Types of Cases and States ( success & failure )
- To Return Two Types for method use (dartz) package
- and use (Either) class and put your Two Types List side and Right
